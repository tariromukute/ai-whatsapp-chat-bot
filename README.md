# AI Whatsapp Chatbot

The aim of this work is to expose the AI tech to persons without good internet access or can't afford good internet access. In most cases (Zimbabwe & South Africa at least) a large subset of these people (students) have Whatsapp bundles. Making this tech available over whatsapp allows a wider reach of the benefits of this technology, helping in reducing the digital divide. I presume it won't be long until Whatsapp also introduces an in app AI chatbot, which would be great - so this is a temporary solution.

Being a Bing API will need to limit the number of interations. Longish term will need to integrate with Azure's Open AI offer - which will need whitelisting, and some funds.
